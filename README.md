# VIP-BDQM-Data Generation-Spring22
This page consist of Boron doped TiO2 with adsorbate, Carbon doped TiO2 with adsorbate and empty slab.

## Boron
Default distance of adsorbate is 1.2 Angstrom (while we used to use 1.348 Angstrom)

1. 14BN2 and 14BO2 means the adsorbate is placed at 1.4 Angstrom
2. BN2 and BO2 is default setting
3. B_Base is empty slab with boron as dopant. 


## Carbon 
Adsorbate is only placed at 1.2 Angstrom
